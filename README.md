This repository contains a proof-of-concept "Roam MCP Proxy" that lets a Custom GPT securely read from and write to a shared Roam Research graph. It provides infrastructure, Lambda container code, and documentation for deploying the proxy and managing access.

```
/infra  - infrastructure-as-code
/src    - Lambda application source
/tests  - test suites
/docs   - project documentation
```

The long-term goal is a production-ready proxy with full observability and analytics of all calls.
